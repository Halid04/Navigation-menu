# My Journey to Becoming a Web Developer Project 3 -Navigation-menu
This codes creates a website that contains a navigation menu with a menu icon, a home icon, an about icon, and a contact icon. The website has an animated background that changes color.

The HTML code creates the structure of the website, where the icons are contained in a div with class "container". The "container" class also has a background animation that changes color and a shadow that extends around the container shape.

The CSS file defines the style of the website, including the animated background color, the size and properties of the elements.

The JavaScript file handles the behavior of the menu. When the user clicks on the menu icon, the container div will change its size and display the home, about, and contact icons. If the user clicks on the menu icon again, the icons will be hidden and the container div will return to its original size.
